    Here, we can copy the style sheet link from the CDN that the website provides 
    and paste it into our HTML fiele as shown below-->

<!-- After putting the links and scripts below and running localhost:3000 
    we will find out Bootstrap is being loaded in the Networks section of Developer Tools-->

<!-- Even after importing socket.io, we will get an error because we are unable to find Socket.IO JavaScript file that we included.-->
<!-- The problem is that we can't directly serve our backend with Express any longer. We have to use Node http server to keep both Express and Socket.IO running -->
<!-- Since we have made HTTP server on node, we cannot serve directly serve our backend with Express any longer. 
     We will use the Node HTTP server, that way both Express and Socket.IO will be running. 
     If we serve directly to express then Socket.IO will not run and give an error on console as Socket.IO and Express are not tied up. 
     But, they are tied up using Node HTTP server. 
     So, we have to use Node HTTP Server to keep both Express and Socket.IO running.
     Hence inside our server.js we can do that by replacing the existing listen code from app.listen to http.listen.
     This will change the server from Express to Node HTTP  -->

<!-- For our demo application the most important will be jQuery. 
    We will be using jQuery in order to inject our data into the HTML, 
    and bind to certain events since we are not using a framework like angular or react-->
