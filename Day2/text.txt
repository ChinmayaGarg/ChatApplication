DataBase Implementation

Many DB Technologies such as MongoDB, MySQL, Veras and many more.
Node has packages to work with most of these options. These all options fall into two categories:
1. SQL   2. NoSQL

SQL
Lot of Up-Front Design
Sometimes performance and query benefits
Sometimes performance hits from overhead

NoSQL
No structure, just collections of any data
Less or no up-front design work
Sometimes performance gains 

No Perfect Solution 
Depends on knowing and understanding your requirements

For this Chat Application we will use NoSQL MongoDB. (Part of MEAN stack)
