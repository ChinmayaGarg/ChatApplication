DataBase Implementation

Many DB Technologies such as MongoDB, MySQL, Veras and many more.
Node has packages to work with most of these options. These all options fall into two categories:
1. SQL   2. NoSQL

SQL
Lot of Up-Front Design
Sometimes performance and query benefits
Sometimes performance hits from overhead

NoSQL
No structure, just collections of any data
Less or no up-front design work
Sometimes performance gains 

No Perfect Solution 
Depends on knowing and understanding your requirements

For this Chat Application we will use NoSQL MongoDB. (Part of MEAN stack)

Setting Up MongoDB Environments
1. We could run and download MongoDB locally but when it will come to publishing the app, 
    a. we will need to host it seperately or 
    b. find a third party host for it.
Hence, we will start by using mLab, a service that offers free hosting. 
mLab is now part of MongoDB and a few things might look different. But the tools to mange a DB should be the same.

Make an account on mLab.com and setup the DB.
After setting up we will connect Node to MongoDB and for this we will use a package called "Mongoose".
