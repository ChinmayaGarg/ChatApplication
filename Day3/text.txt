In asynchronous programming, there is something many programmers refer to as "callback hell".
It can happen to everyone and creates very difficult code.
To understand this problem we will purposefully create this problem by implementing a bad word filter in our code using nested callbacks.

Drawbacks of nested callbacks:
1. Confusing
2. Hard to understand for other team members. Hence, overhead in development process.
Goal/Learning: Make clean code, quick to understand

There are several tools that help us to avoid nested callbacks or "callback hell"

Solution of Nested Callbacks:
1. Promises:
    a. This is one of the options on how to work with asynchronous code.
    b. Promises return an object which promise to do some work.
    c. This object has seperate callbacks for success and failures. This lets us work with asynchronous code in a much more synchronous way.
    d. Best feature of promise: Promises can be combined into dependency chains.
To demonstrate these features of promises we will convert the censor example with nested callbacks to use promises. This will make us see how promises will clean our code.
