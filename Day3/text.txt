In asynchronous programming, there is something many programmers refer to as "callback hell".
It can happen to everyone and creates very difficult code.
To understand this problem we will purposefully create this problem by implementing a bad word filter in our code using nested callbacks.

Drawbacks of nested callbacks:
1. Confusing
2. Hard to understand for other team members. Hence, overhead in development process.
Goal/Learning: Make clean code, quick to understand

There are several tools that help us to avoid nested callbacks or "callback hell"
