try
catch
throw
finally : Gets executed regardless if the try-catch block fails or passes.
          Finally is used in less cases like 
            a. Submitting something to a log, 
            b. A resource that we need to shut down like in case of DB we open a connection, post something and then we might close it in the finally etc.
          Most of the times only try-catch blocks are used.

Exercise Question 1: Change below function to handle error using Error Handling methods

MyFunction(){
    request((result,err)=>console.log(result,err))
}

async MyFunction(){
    try{
        const result = await request();
        console.log(result);
    } catch {
        console.log(err)
    }
}
